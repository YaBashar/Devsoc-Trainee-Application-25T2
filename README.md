# Devsoc-Trainee-Application-25T2

The Theme of this term's Devsoc Training Program Application was "Opposites Attract".
My design involves the Yin and Yang symbol, commonly known for the fact that opposing forces of 
darkness and light are simultaneously complementary and attract each other, which perfectly embodies the Theme.

My design involves  using flexbox to improve responsiveness while adding an interactive
button through manipulating the DOM with JavaScript. I've also optimised the view on mobile using media queries.
